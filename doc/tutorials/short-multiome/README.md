# Context specific network inference and analysis for human blood (PBMC)

This is a [Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys) tutorial to reconstruct and analyze context-specific GRNs from a [10x multiome dataset on PBMC](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-granulocytes-removed-through-cell-sorting-10-k-1-standard-2-0-0). For a full version with details of individual steps, see tutorial [full-multiome](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys/tree/master/doc/tutorials/full-multiome).

To use this tutorial, [install Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#installation), download this folder, and serve the notebook with jupyter inside Dictys' environment. Then execute `notebooks/main.ipynb` for context specific GRN inference and analysis.

If you face any issues or need any assistance, see [FAQ](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#faq) and [Issues](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#issues).
