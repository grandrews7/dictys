# Network analysis for mouse skin

This is a [Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys) tutorial for context specific gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis for SHARE-seq (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility joint quantification) dataset of mouse skin.

This experimental dataset was previously published and annotated in [Ma et al 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.056). We performed context specific network inference. Because the full reproducibility of these steps are affected by various [practical factors and randomness](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#tutorials), here we provide the reconstructed networks as input for this tutorial. This tutorial only reproduces the network analysis part.

To use this tutorial, [install Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#installation), download this folder, and serve the notebook with jupyter inside Dictys' environment. There is only one notebook [notebooks/main.ipynb](notebooks/main.ipynb) for context specific GRN analyses.
