# Dynamic network inference and analysis for mouse skin

This is a [Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys) tutorial for dyamic gene regulatory network (GRN) inference and analysis for SHARE-seq (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility joint quantification) dataset of mouse skin. This experimental dataset was previously published and annotated in [Ma et al 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.056). This is the same dataset used for context specific network inference in our manuscript. Here we infer the developmental trajectories and dynamic networks, and perform dynamic network analysis. TAC-1 differentiation is used as an example for demonstration.

To use this tutorial, first install [Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys#installation) (for network inference and analysis) and [STREAM](https://github.com/pinellolab/STREAM) (for trajectory inference) in separate environments. After downloading this folder, serve and run each notebook in jupyter in order: 1. [notebooks/main1.ipynb](notebooks/main1.ipynb) in STREAM's environment and 2. [notebooks/main2.ipynb](notebooks/main2.ipynb) in Dictys' environment.
